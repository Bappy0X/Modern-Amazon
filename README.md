# Modern-Amazon

The inspiration for this project was fueled by StepZen's "GraphQL: Learn 'n' Hack" Hackathon.

StepZen is a tool for easily creating GraphQL API's - and what I intend to use with this project :)

Helping to brush up my skills, and develop on what I know.

> What is this project?

This is a modernistic build of Amazon. We use Amazon's front end to scrape the selection of products we need, and their info. We then ingest it and display it on the front-end.

It's also a way for me to show off what I've learned in my private repos, and to shop off StepZen.

> What does it use?

This project will comprise of 4 different sections:

- [The AWS Lambda Function](/aws/README.md)
- [The Backend API](/api/README.md)
